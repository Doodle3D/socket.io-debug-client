Socket.io debug client
===================

A simple web interface to debug your socket.io API by chatting with it. 

1. It let's you connect to a socket.io server, 
2. maybe a specific namespace,
3. receive all events,
4. send events,
5. receive responses,
6. all though a familiar chat interface. 

It currently uses yaml to make json easier to read and write. 
Lot's still to do: https://github.com/Doodle3D/socket.io-debug-client/issues
